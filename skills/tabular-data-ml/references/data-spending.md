# Data Spending Methods

## Overview

Data spending refers to the initial splitting of a data set into either:

- training, validation, and test sets, or

- training and test sets

## Training, Validation, and Test Sets

Splits the entire data set into three partitions.

**When to use**: At the very beginning of the modeling process.

**Considerations**:

- When the number of data points is large (say >= 10,000), ask the user if they
  want this type of split.

  - If not, use a basic training/testing split.
- Stratified splitting maintains outcome distribution in each fold

### tidymodels

```r
library(tidymodels)

# Set seed immediately before splitting for reproducibility
set.seed(3847)
init_split <- initial_validation_split(all_data, strata = outcome)
train_data <- training(init_split)
test_data <- testing(init_split)
validation_data <- validation(init_split)

resamples <- validation_set(init_split)
```
## Training and Test Sets

Splits the entire data set into two partitions.

**When to use**: At the very beginning of the modeling process.

**Considerations**:

- Stratified splitting maintains outcome distribution in each fold

### tidymodels

```r
library(tidymodels)

# Set seed immediately before splitting for reproducibility
set.seed(7291)
init_split <- initial_split(all_data, strata = outcome)
train_data <- training(init_split)
test_data <- testing(init_split)
```

## Special Cases

There are several cases when different splitting should be used:

- When the data are a time series

- When there are correlated rows in the data.

### Time Series

In this case, ensure that the data have been ordered from oldest to most recent
data.

#### tidymodels

```r
library(tidymodels)

# Set seed immediately before splitting for reproducibility
set.seed(5628)
init_split <- initial_time_split(all_data)
train_data <- training(init_split)
test_data <- testing(init_split)
```

### Correlated Rows

In this case, the rows of the data are not statistically independent. For
example, if patients in a clinical trial are measured more than once, the data
for a given patient are correlated.

To make the split, there must be a column in the data that corresponds to the
independent experimental unit (e.g., patient).

#### tidymodels

```r
library(tidymodels)

# Set seed immediately before splitting for reproducibility
set.seed(4182)
init_split <- group_initial_split(all_data, group = id_column)
train_data <- training(init_split)
test_data <- testing(init_split)
```
