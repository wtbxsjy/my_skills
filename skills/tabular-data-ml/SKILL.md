# Tabular Data Machine Learning

This skill guides the process of developing predictive models for tabular data
with proper validation practices.

## Data Spending Strategy

Always partition data into:

- **Training set**: Used for all feature engineering, feature selection, and
  model development

- **Test set**: Reserved for final model evaluation only—requires explicit user
  permission before use

A common split is 75% training / 25% testing. Use stratified sampling:

- Classification: stratify by outcome class

- Regression: create temporary quartile groups and stratify by those

See [references/data-spending.md](references/data-spending.md) for specific
instructions for data splitting.

### Test Set Rules

- **NEVER** predict on test data during model development

- **NEVER** calculate test set metrics without explicit user permission

- **NEVER** use test data to compare models or tune hyperparameters

- **DO** ask: *"If you have completed model development, may I evaluate the
  final model on the test set?"*

- **DO** wait for explicit confirmation before proceeding

**Self-check**: If you're writing `predict(..., test_data)` without prior user
permission, STOP—you're making an error.

**Exception**: Basic verification after splitting (e.g., `nrow(test_data)`,
`glimpse(test_data)`) to confirm the split worked.

## Reproducibility

**Always set a random seed before any operation that involves randomness:**

- **Before data splitting** - Set seed immediately before `initial_split()`,
  `initial_time_split()`, etc.

- **Before resampling** - Set seed immediately before `vfold_cv()`,
  `sliding_period()`, etc.

- **Before tuning** - Set seed before `tune_grid()` or other tuning functions
  (if not already set recently)

This ensures that others can reproduce your exact results. Use a single seed at
the start of your script, or re-set it before each random operation for maximum
clarity.

### Choosing a Seed Value

**Do not use common values like 123, 111, 999, 42, or 1:** These are overused
and can lead to unintentional correlations between different analyses. Using the
same seed as other researchers' work may produce accidentally similar results.

**Good practices:**

- Use a random integer between 1000 and 10000 (e.g., 3847, 7291, 5628)

- Different seeds for different projects/analyses

- Document your seed choice in comments for reference

## Empirical Validation

Always use out-of-sample predictions to measure performance:

- **Large datasets (≥10,000 rows)**: Use a single validation set

- **Small to medium datasets**: Use 10-fold cross-validation or appropriate
  resampling

See [references/resampling.md](references/resampling.md) for resampling methods
and implementation.

### Parallel Processing

Before starting computationally intensive work (cross-validation, tuning, model
fitting):

1. **Detect available cores**: Use `parallel::detectCores()` to check system
   resources

2. **Ask the user in the conversation** - Don't just put a comment in code -
   have an actual exchange

**Example interaction:**

> **You:** I'm about to run 10-fold cross-validation with hyperparameter tuning.
> I can use parallel processing to speed this up significantly.
>
> I see you have 8 cores available. Would you like me to use parallel
> processing? If so, how many cores should I use? (I'd recommend using 6-7 to
> leave 1-2 cores free for other processes)

**If user says yes:**

```r
library(future)
plan("multisession", workers = 6)  # or whatever they specified
```

**If user says no or doesn't respond:**

```r
# Proceed with sequential processing (no future setup)
```

**If user is unsure:**

> **You:** Here's the trade-off: - **With parallel processing (6 cores)**:
> \~5-10 minutes - **Without (sequential)**: \~30-45 minutes
>
> Your choice won't affect the results, just the speed.

3. **Continue using** the same parallel configuration throughout unless the user
   asks to stop

**Do not** automatically enable parallel processing without asking the user
first.

### Validation Rules

- **NEVER** directly predict on training data to measure performance

- **DO** develop and compare models using only CV or validation set results

- **DO** select final model(s) based on out-of-sample performance

## Performance Metrics

See [references/evaluation.md](references/evaluation.md) for specific
instructions for computing performance metrics.

### Classification

Ask the user whether they prioritize:

- **Class separation**: Use ROC-AUC or PR-AUC

- **Calibrated probabilities**: Use Brier score

Default set: ROC-AUC, Brier score, and accuracy.

### Regression

- **RMSE**: Primary accuracy metric (sensitive to outliers)

- **MAE**: Accuracy metric less sensitive to outliers

- **R²**: Measures variance explained (supplement to RMSE/MAE, not a
  replacement)

Default set: RMSE and R².

## Model Optimization

The modeling process is iterative. Three main levers for improvement:

1. **Feature engineering**: Modify predictors so the model does less work
2. **Model selection**: Choose appropriate algorithm for data characteristics
3. **Hyperparameter tuning**: Optimize parameters that can't be estimated from
   data

All steps must be validated using out-of-sample data.

### Optimization Rules

- **NEVER** use data outside the training set to determine feature engineering
  steps

- **NEVER** engineer features, then evaluate directly on training data

- **DO** treat feature engineering and model training as a single process

- **DO** use CV or validation set to measure combined feature engineering +
  model performance

- **DO** use CV or validation set to select best tuning parameters

## Feature Engineering

See [references/feature-engineering.md](references/feature-engineering.md) for:

- Common feature engineering techniques

- Model-specific requirements (mandatory vs. helpful transformations)

## Model Tuning

- Use parameter ranges provided by the modeling framework

- Use space-filling designs for grid search when available

- Use racing methods for efficiency (except with validation sets)

- Visualize tuning results to show performance vs. parameter relationships

It is a good idea to propose two models to the user:

- a regularized linear (or logistic) model such as `glmnet`

- a boosted tree with an early stopping argument to halt after 5 poor
  iterations.

See [references/tuning.md](references/tuning.md) for details on tuning methods
and implementation.

## Model Evaluation

See [references/tuning.md](references/tuning.md) for details on tuning methods
and implementation.

**Without tuning**: Resample the model or use a validation set. Report
out-of-sample metrics.

**With tuning**: Select metric to optimize, identify optimal tuning parameters.

For the best model, present:

- Numeric metric results

- Appropriate visualizations (see below)

### Evaluation Visualizations

**Classification**:

- ROC or PR curves

- Calibration curves

**Regression**:

- Observed vs. predicted plots

- Residual plots

See [references/evaluation.md](references/evaluation.md) for metrics,
visualizations, and implementation.

## Final Model

Once the user selects a final model, fit it on the entire training set.

## Test Set Evaluation

After receiving user permission, evaluate on the test set with:

- Numeric metrics

- Same visualizations as model evaluation (ROC/PR curves, calibration, observed
  vs. predicted, residuals)
